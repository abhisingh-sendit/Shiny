## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
csv_filenames <- list.files('./DrivingSummary', pattern = 'csv')
csv_filepaths <- paste0( './DrivingSummary/', csv_filenames, sep = '' )
all_dfs <- lapply( csv_filepaths, FUN = function( fp ) read.csv( fp, stringsAsFactors = F ) )

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
g1 <- ggplot(data = drive, aes(group= YEAR, x = YEAR, y = AVG.)) + geom_boxplot()

g1
```
